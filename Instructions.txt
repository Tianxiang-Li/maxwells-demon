Class MaxwellsDemon contains main() to start. 

To start the game, compile the project and execute "java MaxwellsDemon".

In the game, you are initially given with 10 random particles in the playing area. The speed and location of these particles are randomly chosen.

Pressing the mouse anywhere other than the buttons will open the door on the wall of the playing area. While the door is open, all the particles are free to move through out the playing area.

Releasing the mouse will close the door, and the particles will remain seperated in their corresponding chambers.

Clicking "reset" button will reset the game to the initial state. Clicking "add" button will add a fast particle and a slow one in each chamber, which results in 4 addition particals in total.

Each chamber has an average temperature displayed towards the bottom of the chamber. It is calculated as the average of the squares of particles' velocities.
